# Pack Christmas Project 2021

As you may or may not know, it's our SUSE Packaging team tradition to bring you a Christmas surprise from our Pack workshop every year. Usually, we share it right before Christmas, but this time, we need to share it earlier - on the 1st of December. This year, we prepared a Packaging Advent Calendar that will accompany you through the Advent Season, bringing you some Christmas mood and teaching you some of the packaging magic. So enjoy and don't forget to go back tomorrow since you will be able to open one door each day until Christmas Eve.

We wish you a happy Advent season and have a lot of fun!

Your Packaging Team
